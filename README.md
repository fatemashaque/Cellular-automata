# Cellular-automata

This program simulates Elementary Cellular Automata using Java.

The user must be able to provide these two things: as arguments when executing the program from Console:

the number of iterations (any integer n)
the Rule Number (an integer from 0 to 255)
The program will initialize the grid to a width of n × 2, with a single cell set to true/alive in the centre. It will then display the iterations of the automaton in console.

Example run command in Console: java CA 20 223 will create an automaton with grid width (20 × 2 =) 40, and will run for 20 iterations using Rule 223.
